# Figures Module - Modernized Visualization System

This document describes the modernized figures module for drift-benchmark analysis, designed to provide research-quality visualizations suitable for publication and comprehensive benchmark analysis.

## üìä Overview

The figures module has been completely refactored to provide:

- **Modular visualization system** with specialized analysis modules
- **Research-quality figures** with statistical rigor and publication standards
- **Meaningful comparisons** that highlight important differences between libraries, methods, and scenarios
- **Advanced analysis capabilities** including cross-library consistency, implementation trade-offs, and method family comparisons
- **Backward compatibility** with existing scripts and workflows

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **More Meaningful Plots**

Instead of simple detection percentages that don't tell the full story, the new system provides:

- **Context-aware analysis** that considers drift expectations vs actual detection
- **Statistical significance testing** with confidence intervals and p-values
- **Trade-off analysis** showing accuracy vs speed relationships
- **Consistency metrics** measuring cross-library implementation reliability
- **Efficiency scoring** combining detection rate with execution performance

### 2. **Better Titles and Labels**

All plots now have:

- **Descriptive titles** explaining what is being measured and why it matters
- **Clear axis labels** with units and context
- **Statistical annotations** showing significance levels and confidence intervals
- **Performance summaries** highlighting key findings
- **Research-focused captions** suitable for academic papers

### 3. **Advanced Cross-Library Comparisons**

The new system provides sophisticated analysis of:

- **Implementation consistency** across different libraries for the same methods
- **Performance variations** and optimization trade-offs
- **Feature coverage** and adapter reliability
- **Execution mode comparisons** (batch vs streaming)
- **Method family analysis** by mathematical approach

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### New Research-Quality Interface (Recommended)

```python
from figures import create_research_quality_figures

# Generate all research-quality figures
saved_figures = create_research_quality_figures(
    results=benchmark_results,
    output_dir=Path("analysis/research_figures"),
    formats=['png', 'pdf'],  # Multiple formats for publication
)

# Focus on specific analysis type
from figures import create_focused_analysis_figure

fig = create_focused_analysis_figure(
    results=benchmark_results,
    analysis_type='performance',  # or 'scenario', 'execution_mode', 'method_family', 'adapter'
    focus='implementation_consistency',
    save_path=Path("analysis/performance_analysis.pdf")
)
```

### Individual Specialized Figures

```python
from figures.modules import (
    create_performance_comparison_figure,
    create_scenario_analysis_figure,
    create_execution_mode_figure,
    create_method_family_figure,
    create_adapter_comparison_figure
)

# Library performance comparison
perf_fig = create_performance_comparison_figure(
    results, 
    save_path=Path("analysis/performance.pdf"),
    focus='comprehensive'  # or 'execution_time', 'detection_accuracy', 'robustness'
)

# Scenario difficulty analysis
scenario_fig = create_scenario_analysis_figure(
    results,
    save_path=Path("analysis/scenarios.pdf"), 
    focus='difficulty_ranking'  # or 'drift_types', 'data_sources'
)

# Batch vs streaming comparison
exec_fig = create_execution_mode_figure(
    results,
    save_path=Path("analysis/execution_modes.pdf"),
    focus='trade_offs'  # or 'scalability', 'latency_analysis'
)
```

### Legacy Interface (Backward Compatibility)

```python
from figures import create_comprehensive_report

# Existing scripts continue to work
plot_paths = create_comprehensive_report(
    results=benchmark_results,
    output_dir=Path("analysis")
)
```

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From Legacy to New System

```python
# Old approach
from figures.plots import plot_execution_time_comparison
fig = plot_execution_time_comparison(results, save_path)

# New approach (more comprehensive)
from figures import create_focused_analysis_figure
fig = create_focused_analysis_figure(
    results, 
    analysis_type='performance',
    focus='execution_time',
    save_path=save_path,
    formats=['png', 'pdf']
)
```

### Script Integration

For existing scripts using `run_benchmarks_analysis.py`:

```python
# The script automatically detects and uses the new system
# No changes needed to existing command-line usage:
python scripts/run_benchmarks_analysis.py --config my_config.toml
```

## üìù Best Practices for Research Papers

### 1. Figure Selection

- **Performance studies:** Use performance_comparison + adapter_comparison
- **Method evaluation:** Use method_family_analysis + scenario_analysis  
- **System design:** Use execution_mode_analysis + performance_comparison
- **Reproducibility:** Use adapter_comparison for cross-library validation

### 2. Statistical Reporting

- Always include confidence intervals for performance metrics
- Report statistical significance for comparative claims
- Use effect sizes to quantify practical significance
- Include sample sizes and success rates

### 3. Publication Formats

- Generate figures in both PNG (for review) and PDF (for publication)
- Use vector formats (SVG, PDF) for scalable graphics
- Include high-DPI versions for print publications

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new visualization modules:

1. Extend the base `BenchmarkDataProcessor` class
2. Follow the modular design pattern with focus options
3. Include statistical rigor features (confidence intervals, significance tests)
4. Provide comprehensive docstrings with research questions
5. Add appropriate error handling and data validation
6. Include both publication and interactive viewing modes

## üìö Dependencies

The new system requires:

- `matplotlib >= 3.5.0` for advanced plotting features
- `seaborn >= 0.11.0` for statistical visualizations
- `scipy >= 1.7.0` for statistical tests
- `pandas >= 1.3.0` for data processing
- `numpy >= 1.21.0` for numerical computations
- `scikit-learn >= 1.0.0` for clustering and preprocessing (optional)

Legacy fallback functions work with minimal dependencies for backward compatibility.
